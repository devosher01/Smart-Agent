# 🚀 Hack2Build: Payments x402 Edition

**AI-Powered Identity Validation Agent with Blockchain Payments**

Join us for an incredible 2.5 weeks long hackathon where developers, product designers, and entrepreneurs come together to build the next generation of AI+Blockchain interactions using the **x402 protocol** (HTTP 402 Payment Required) on Avalanche.

## 🎯 Hackathon Goals

- **Innovation**: Breakthrough ideas that push the boundaries of what's possible
- **Technical Excellence**: Well-architected, secure, and scalable solutions
- **User Experience**: Applications that are intuitive and accessible to everyone
- **Real-World Impact**: Solutions that solve actual problems and create value

## 📋 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an **AI Agent** that can validate identities and perform other tasks, seamlessly integrated with blockchain payments using the **x402 protocol** on Avalanche C-Chain. The agent uses Google Gemini for natural language understanding and can automatically handle payment flows when accessing paid APIs.

### What We Built

A conversational AI agent that:
- 🤖 Understands natural language requests (powered by Google Gemini)
- 💬 Maintains conversation context and history
- 🔧 Can call external APIs as "tools" based on user requests
- 💰 Automatically handles blockchain payments via x402 protocol
- 🔐 Uses a built-in burner wallet for seamless payment experience
- ⚡ Integrates with Avalanche C-Chain for fast, low-cost transactions

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+
- npm or yarn
- Backend server running (see main repo)
- Smart contract deployed on Avalanche C-Chain
- Test AVAX for transactions

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`

### Configuration

Update the API URL in `src/app/app.ts`:

```typescript
baseUrl = 'https://verifik.app'; // or 'http://localhost:3000' for local dev
```

## 📖 How It Works

1. **Wallet Setup**: On first load, a random wallet is generated and stored in localStorage
2. **Fund Wallet**: Send test AVAX to the displayed wallet address
3. **Chat**: Ask the agent to validate an ID (e.g., "Validate ID 12345678")
4. **AI Processing**: The agent uses Gemini to understand the request and determine which tool to call
5. **Payment Detection**: If the API requires payment, it returns a 402 status with payment details
6. **Payment Flow**: 
   - Agent requests payment confirmation
   - User approves
   - Smart contract function is called with proper gas estimation
   - Transaction is sent to Avalanche
7. **Retry**: Agent automatically retries the API call with payment transaction hash
8. **Result**: Validation results are displayed to the user

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Smart Contract Interaction

The agent calls the `payForService` function on the x402 contract:

```solidity
function payForService(string serviceId, string requestId) public payable
```

### Payment Flow

1. API returns `402 Payment Required` with:
   ```json
   {
     "error": "Payment Required",
     "details": {
       "receiver_address": "0x...",
       "amount": "0.001",
       "serviceId": "cedula-validation",
       "requestId": "req_1234567890"
     }
   }
   ```

2. Frontend calls contract:
   ```typescript
   contract.payForService(serviceId, requestId, { value: amount })
   ```

3. Backend verifies payment by checking transaction on-chain

### Gas Estimation

The wallet service includes smart gas estimation:
- Attempts to estimate gas for the contract call
- Adds 20% buffer for safety
- Falls back to 120k gas if estimation fails
- Handles both legacy and EIP-1559 transactions

### Note: x402 vs ERC8004

**We're using x402 (HTTP 402 Payment Required), not ERC8004.**

- **x402 Protocol**: HTTP status code 402 for payment-gated API access. Our implementation uses a simple smart contract to accept payments before providing API services.

- **ERC8004**: A different standard for AI agent identity, reputation, and validation on-chain (ERC-721 agent identities, reputation registry, validation proofs). We are **not** implementing ERC8004 in this project.

Our contract is a simple payment contract that follows the x402 pattern: API returns 402 → User pays via contract → API verifies payment → Service provided.
